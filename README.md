A collection of 100 python projects from beginner to advanced to enhance and showcase my python skills.ðŸ˜Š 

## Welcome to my 100 Python Projects repository!
This is a personal portfolio challenge where I build 100 small to medium Python projects to practice, enhance, and showcase my coding skills. The projects progress from beginner to advancedâ€”covering basic syntax, data structures, algorithms, games, automation, web development, and more.
The goal is to learn by building, improve problem-solving skills, and create a body of work I can share with others.

ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure is three folder categorized into, begginer, intermediate, Advanced.

### About the Projects
So far, Iâ€™ve been working on beginner-level projects like Hello World, Basic Calculator, Number Guessing Game, Leap Year Checker, BMI Calculator, Password Generator, and Countdown Timer.

These projects have been really helping me practice the basics of Python: things like variables, data types, loops, conditionals, functions, and how to work with user input and output.

This whole challenge is part of my personal learning journeyâ€”building small projects to get better every day, document my portfolio, and grow my coding skills in a fun and practical way.


### Why This Challenge?
Practice coding regularly
Build a portfolio of real projects
Improve problem-solving skills
Showcase growth over time.
